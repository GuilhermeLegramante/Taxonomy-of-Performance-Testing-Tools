# Taxonomy of Performance Testing Tools: a Systematic Literature Review

Background: The knowledge and application of tools to automate performance testing is essential to ensure software reliability and therefore its quality. Aims: To investigate, identify and characterize existing performance testing tools reported in the literature. Method: A protocol was formulated and executed according to the guidelines for performing systematic literature reviews in Software Engineering. Results: The performance testing tools were classified according to their relevance in the literature, highlighting the most commonly used tools, their supported input approaches, workload approaches, monitored metrics and logging strategies. 
From the analysis of these results a taxonomy on performance testing tools was proposed. Conclusion: With the results of this study, it was possible to quantify and qualify research related to existing performance testing tools in the literature, and also to characterize these tools. The study would also help professionals, researchers and academic students looking for new tools or tools that have certain peculiarities in their features for decision-making on performance testing strategies.
